# PTPD FOR STM32H7 AND ATSAME70

IEEE 1588 PTP daemon for STM32H7 and ATSAME70 microcontrollers. The software is tested to work with LWIP 2.x.

## Usage
1. Enable IGMP in LWIP and make sure it is working. Typically this is done by defining LWIP_IGMP to 1 in _lwipopts.h_. You typically need to enable IGMP in your network interface as well (for example netif->flags |= NETIF_FLAG_IGMP).
2. Copy-paste the _ptp_ folder to your solution.
3. From _port_ folder copy _constants_dep.h_, _ptpd_dep.c_ and _ptpd_dep.h_ files to the _ptp/dep_ folder. From _port_ folder copy _constants.h_ to _ptp_ folder.
4. Every 1 ms update the PTPD timers, for example as below
    ```
    // ptpd timers
    for (uint8_t i=0; i < TIMER_ARRAY_SIZE; i++)
    {
        switch (ptpdTimersCounter[i])
        {
            case 0:
            break;
            case 1:
            ptpdTimersExpired[i] = TRUE;
            ptpdTimersCounter[i] = ptpdTimers[i];
            break;
            default :
            ptpdTimersCounter[i]--;
            break;
        }
    }
    ```
5. In the software initilization call function ptpd_init().
6. Continuously call function ptpd_task(). Remember to call igmp_timer() every 100 ms as well.
